# Little Chick Baby App

The brief: to create an app that would help all carers.

As a new mum I realised quickly the importance of making sure I had certain information at the tip of my fingertips. I looked online for an app that would store all of this important infomation but unfortunatly there wasn't one. After talking to my midwife I realised quickly if I wanted to help new mums or even just tired parent look after their little chicks then I would need to create it.

## Color Reference

| Color             | Hex                                                                |

| Pink colour| ![#F589A4](https://via.placeholder.com/10/F589A4?text=+) #F589A4 |
| Other colour| ![#C2E7EACA58DA](https://via.placeholder.com/10/EACA58?text=+) #EACA58 |

I choose these colours to help with accessibility so the app truely was for all. I also checked how these colours worked with colour blindness.
